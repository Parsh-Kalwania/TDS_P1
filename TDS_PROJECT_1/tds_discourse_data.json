      "Subject: Issue with Scraping BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan JSON Forecast Question 4: Scraping BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan Weather Forecast I’m trying to retrieve the JSON weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan using the BBC Weather API. However, I noticed that the BBC website lists the city as “Astana” instead of Nur-Sultan. When I attempt to use the JSON data for Astana, I encounter the following error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’) How should I proceed to correctly scrape the weather forecast for Nur-Sultan?  how can I resolve the TypeError issue? Any guidance on handling city name",
      "Hello, @Jivraj @carlton @HritikRoshan_HRM In GA4 Q2 it is mentioned that result changes as per location. I am getting this error: At [ 4 ].title: Values don 't match . Expected: \"5. La Nuit des clowns\" . Actual: \"5. Clown in a Cornfield\" But when checked manually, the result I got was correct as per the filters applied. The difference seems to be due to region-specific variations in IMDb search results. Can you please clarify what should be done in such cases? Should we proceed with the region-specific result, or is there a standard way to align the output with the expected values?",

      "Can some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?",
      "From the graded assignment we can’t understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.",
      "Apart from what @CKPIITM observed about this course, here’s my first impression of this course…Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway… The week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective.  It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard.  The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point.  What’s the context and the motivation?  Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text.  Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.  Neither does give me much understanding anyway.  It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up.  The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem. Summary.  I feel the course is offered too early.  Rather, I took it a little too early. Definitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about.  At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program.  I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how. Sorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one.  I just had to.  I’m willing to hear different opinions. I’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.",
      "I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME. Hopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.",
      "I feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don’t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation. But I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.",
      "As of now, I’m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week.  Will continue after all other ML courses are done…",
      "Some sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts. In the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.",
      "Adding to the discussion here, I’d also have to say it’s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it’s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.",
      "Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it. The other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.",
      "I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.",
      "As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don’t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.",
      "well, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors. The recording was perhaps done much earlier as @CKPIITM pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded.  So, lesser chances to re-record them. There are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation. Finally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.",
      "Imagine if your reason doesn’t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don’t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material. @Anand",
      "CKPIITM: I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. wasn’t it you who wrote this earlier",
      "But this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn. I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.",
      "I certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread. In my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.",
      "I also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.",
      "I too find content of week 1 engaging and practical. I agree with @anand095 and @akruti .",
      "Interesting!  Just this morning, during my morning walk I was thinking how each of us is different in our outlook, our potential, how we realize it, how we’re challenged…and the recent posts show that we indeed are different!  It’s important that none of us stay put on what works for us and what we think is right, but be willing to see the other point of view too… I think I’m starting to understand the other points of view…well I’m trying to",
      "I absolutely see no problem when others find it really engaging, infact they are the bunch of lucky candidate and probably they can help us too in better understanding of some of the confusion which came along with questions. Plz start pouring your understanding of lecture here in brief,  Let’s help each other."

      "i am currently running it in local host 8000 other functionalities are working this is the problem data scraping",
      "Okay, I will explain it to you. Upon visiting discourse and signing in with your account, you get ‘cookies’ containing information that can be used to authorize you. These cookies are sent with each subsequent request you make to discourse, if the website does not recognize these cookies , they simply reject your request with a status code of 403. If you want to scrape the posts, you need to get these cookies . So, where are these cookies stored? Well, just sign into discourse with your IITM account (in Chrome). Then, visit the following URL: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/session/current.json Once the page has opened and you can see JSON data, do the following: right click > inspect > application > cookies > https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/ . Now, you will see a bunch of cookies, which are similar to a python dictionary containing key-value pairs. You only care about two such keys, one is _t and the other one is _forum_session . Save the value of these cookie keys in a python file like my_cookies.py : # my_cookies.py _t = \"your _t cookie\" _forum_session = \"your _forum_session cookie\" Now, these can be imported into other files using: from my_cookies import _t, _forum_session\n\nauth_cookie: dict = { '_t' : _t , '_forum_session' : _forum_session } Note that these cookies keep changing , when you make new requests you get different values that replace the current values of your session . You can think of the session as a user. Now, look at my previous reply: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/help-required-in-project-1-scrapping-discourse-data/179153/2?u=23f1000917 The requests module is used to send requests to websites in python.  You need to install it using pip install requests . You create a session object and add your cookies in it. This automatically handles the changing and replacement of cookie values when you make requests. Search for a tutorial on the requests module to understand how to make requests using it. Just know that you can do the something like this: import requests \n\nURL = \"https://example.com/latest_threads.json\" session = requests.Session()\nresponse = session.get(URL) if response.status_code= 200 :\n    data = response.json() # get json data Lastly, watch the live sessions conducted by IITM on 10th June and next few days. You can find them in your google calendar.",

      "@carlton and @Jivraj Respected Sir It was my first time doing web scraping and other tasks required for this project. After watching the live sessions, I realized that my approach was wrong. The live sessions are really good but , they are being conducted too close to the deadline (started on 10th June). In the sessions, it was said that this project could be completed in a day, but I don’t feel that this is the case for me (not even close), though that might just be my own inefficiency. Aside from that, the method of using the Gemini model demonstrated in the sessions only allowed me to generate embeddings for the first 100 chunks (max per day), there are way more than that in my workflow. I have to spend time finding other alternatives to create embeddings before I make the final submission with the openAI api. So, I humbly request, if it is possible, please consider extending the deadline by a few days. There is not enough time to absorb what was taught in the live sessions and implement it as complete beginner. Thank you.",

EDIT: enabling CORS let me send an OPTIONS request from the submission form so i was able to submit. later i sent promptfoo as well as regular curls to Render url and they worked too. Although once it shut down, it just isn’t starting back up again; sending curls now gives me some really long html and doesn’t even send any api calls to the render url. what to do? @carlton @Jivraj"
